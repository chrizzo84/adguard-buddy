# ✨ What's New in AdGuard Buddy ✨

**August 23, 2025**

We're excited to introduce some brand new features to AdGuard Buddy!

## 📊 Combined Statistics! (As in issue #1 wanted)

We've added a new feature that allows you to view combined statistics from all your AdGuard Home instances in one place.

*   **Get the big picture!** 📈 Now you can see the total number of queries, blocked queries, and more from all your servers combined.
*   **Easy to use!** 💻 The combined statistics are displayed in a new section on the statistics page.

## 🚀 A Brand New "What's New" Popup!

We've added a "What's New" popup to keep you informed about the latest changes and improvements to AdGuard Buddy.

*   **Stay up-to-date!** 📰 Now you'll get a notification right in the app whenever we make changes.
*   **Sleek new design!** 🎨 We've designed the popup to be clean, modern, and easy on the eyes. We've also added full dark mode support! 
*   **Powered by Markdown!** 📝 The content of the popup is rendered from a simple Markdown file, so it's easy to read and maintain.
